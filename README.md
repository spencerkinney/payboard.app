# payboard.app

## Introduction
Hello! I created this small repository to serve as an update log for the payboard.app project. I just started working on this project around two weeks ago from when I'm writing this. A little bit of background: I myself use many different eWallet services such as Venmo, PayPal, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, etc... By the way, let's not get semantical and debate wether or not all of these are actually considered 'eWallets' ðŸ™‚.

The (current) goal of this project is to develop a very simple mobile-focused application where you can generate a web page of all your eWallet usernames/addresses and send that link to your friends.

## Application
So... I went ahead and made a very simple app that does this of course: www.payboard.app

Check it out! You can make an account and use the service if you'd like. There are many new features coming in the near future.

You can also check out my page here: https://www.payboard.app/u/spencer I am using the 'Cloudy' theme from the *Settings* page :)

## Technical Stuff
As you may be able to see, there is no code within this repository. That is because I do not have any immediate plans to open source this application. I have future ideas for the project and would like to continue to grow it; releasing the code (at this time atleast) could pose some security issues. *However*, I will certainly release some code for any handy reusable components that I create.

If you were also wondering about the tech stack! I am using Django for the backend and HTML/Bootstrap/ReactJS for the interface.

## Todo List
Here is a list of features that I am currently working on:
- More eWallets supported, there are only a few options right now. I'll fix that.
- Drag and drop customization
- Scannable QR codes
- Improved cosmetics
- Sharing your links via SMS
- Account features: email confirmation, 'Forgot my Password', etc..
- Validating entered crypto addresses
